# ICRC Global Cyber Hub
The [International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)](https://www.icrc.org/en/about-international-committee-red-cross-icrc)'s Global Cyber Hub, based in Luxembourg, aims to explore new ways to support, enable, and protect the ICRC’s digital footprint and to ensure that the ICRC can effectively leverage digital tools while upholding the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, including neutrality, impartiality, and independence in an increasingly digital world. The Global Cyber Hub's vision is to provide the ICRC with the tools it needs to remain a neutral, independent, and impartial actor in the digital age capable of harnessing digital innovation to enhance its humanitarian mission while mitigating the associated risks. 

# Engagement with Open Source Communities
Digital and especially FOSS tools offer humanitarian organizations like the ICRC the opportunity to reach more affected people, and to provide humanitarian services more efficiently and effectively. In light of this, the ICRC is actively developing and contributing to several FOSS projects aimed at creating secure, reliable and scalable FOSS to better serve affected populations.

The ICRC would like to engage with with broader tech and developer communities to seek their support in the ICRC’s efforts to deliver a set of neutral and independent, safe, and secure software tools for the benefit of affected people while contributing to the principled and responsible digital transformation of humanitarian action.
